# emu-chip8
CHIP8 emulator based off of this article http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/
Currently game to load is hardcoded in the main.cpp

### Required libraries
Requires SFML to compile and run

### ROMS
They're all easily searchable online
I tested with some games from this set http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html
